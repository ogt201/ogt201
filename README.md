- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Oliver Tebbs.
- ðŸ“ˆ Iâ€™m interested in applying mathematical modelling in both biological and medical disciplines, through the use of coding languages such as Python, Matlab and Rstudio.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working towards my dissertation project - 'Quantifying chemical contributions to wave propagation in neurons'. For this project, I'll be working in
Matlab to model the infamous Hodgkin-Huxley equations and attempt to introduce a term to account for the chemical changes previously ignored by the model.
